Maximum occured Integer
In this GFG POTD, we are given two arrays as input, along with their respective length n and the maximum element, maxx.
Here's a python code following the prefix sum method to this question:
def maxOccured(self,n, l, r, maxx):
        #we initialised a array of size maxx+2 elements, having all zero in it
        arr = [0]*(maxx+2)
        #for the given two arrays left and right, we increment the value of the start index and decrement the value of end index in the array initialsed in previous step
        for i in range(n):
            arr[l[i]] += 1
            arr[r[i]+1] -= 1

        #we calculate the prefix sum of array arr
        for i in range(1,maxx+1):
            arr[i] = arr[i] + arr[i-1]

        #here we are returning the index of the element having maximum value
        res = 0
        max_count = 0
        for i in range(1,maxx+1):
            if arr[i] > max_count:
                max_count = arr[i]
                res = i
        return res
